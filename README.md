# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Corbin Buff

I took this class because I'm fascinated by internet web design and web development. I ultimately want to do something where I'm building/making/designing things for people, and get bored if I am not learning something new, so I think the field could be a good fit. I only have a basic knowledge of html and css and really want to learn javascript and become a better developer.

I learned that:
1. The web and the internet are not the same thing
2. The internet is made up of wires
3. The internet allows for multiple computers to communicate with each other
