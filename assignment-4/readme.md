## Assignment 4 README

Divs are used to specify a large area of html. Classes are used to specify multiple html elements. IDs are used to specify a specific html element. Spans are used to specify a small area of html.

Alt text is used in case a form of media will not work or display in the browser as an alternate way of communicating what it is.

I learned a lot about incorporating multiple forms of media in this work cycle. The only sticking point for me was incorporating a specific location on the map iframe. It seems to just insert a random map without the location I specified. Other than that everything went well.
