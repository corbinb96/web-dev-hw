 <h1> Lyrics </h1>
<pre>
 I am a man who walks alone
 And when I'm walking a dark road
 At night or strolling through the park
 When the light begins to change
 I sometimes feel a little strange
 A little anxious when it's dark

 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a constant fear that something's always near
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a phobia that someone's always there

 Have you run your fingers down the wall
 And have you felt your neck skin crawl
 When you're searching for the light?
 Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
 At the corner of the room
 You've sensed that something's watching you

 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a constant fear that something's always near
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a phobia that someone's always there

 Have you ever been alone at night
 Thought you heard footsteps behind
 And turned around and no one's there?
 And as you quicken up your pace
 You find it hard to look again
 Because you're sure there's someone there

 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a constant fear that something's always near
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a phobia that someone's always there
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark

 Watching horror films the night before
 Debating witches and folklore
 The unknown troubles on your mind
 Maybe your mind is playing tricks
 You sense and suddenly eyes fix
 On dancing shadows from behind

 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a constant fear that something's always near
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a phobia that someone's always there

 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a constant fear that something's always near
 Fear of the dark
 Fear of the dark
 I have a phobia that someone's always there

 When I'm walking a dark road
 I am a man who walks alone
